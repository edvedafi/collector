collector
=========

A Grails app to manage a collection of sports memorabilia.

This application is a playground for learning now technologies.  As such it will start out as a Grails application
backed by a cassandra database as that is my current interest.  Over time I intend to weave in a little scala
and who knows where else it will go.
